1. I believe it is to make it easier to access. For example in our main we just needed to make one struct in where it would 
allow us easy access to all of the structs inside with each of their members.
2. Milestone 2 was the most difficult for me. Mainly the parts where we had to take strings from the user, until we cleared
the buffer, it sometimes skips to the next line without waiting for the user input.
3. I completed it in the same class we did milestone 3.
