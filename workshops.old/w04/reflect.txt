1. It is decalred to hold ten elements because we ask the user to enter the number of days between 3 and 10.
If the user decides to enter 10, the array already has enough space to store 10 elements.
2. The advantage is that you can store paired information such as item number and its price or
students and thier grades. One disadvantage is that if you want to remove a value from one, you need to fix the other on as well
which can be difficult or messy.
3. The home portion for this workshop was just right. The most difficult part was adjusting the average
temperature to the number of days they asked for.
